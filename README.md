# strapi .NET bridge
## alternative ideas
dream development setup boilerplate?

## obsidian-100 ðŸ¤”?
**The name of the repo (and the fact of it being a fork of obsidian plugin template) has nothing to do with the project.**
The reason is the repo has been committed to a contest https://100commitow.pl/ and I did not manage
to change it before the contest started.

## motivation
When working with Strapi CMS and a .NET backend I've been creating ad-hock methods and clients to integrate with Strapi. 
The goal is to create a more structurized solution and possibly learn a bit in process :).

## goal
The goal is to create a quite generic scripts/program that does as much of the mundane job of integrating with Strapi as possible.

### steps
This is a very rough initial idea of what the steps **might** include.
A more throughrough research of what is possible (and what is feasible) is needed.

* handling strapi json model (data, attributes, all kind of strapi wrappers around models)
* creating c# models for models in strapi


## technologies considered
Any technology that might help the cause will be welcome.
Initially, the plan is to use C#/.NET, Powershell 7 and if it's justifiable to do so, C# Source Generators (I've been looking for an opportunity to use).

## additional goals
Use conventional commits, achieve sensible test coverage.
